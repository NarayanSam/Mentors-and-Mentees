<h2>What is an ideal career path?
</h2>
<p class="text">The definition of a career path differs from the job that a person holds. Your career path is made up of a series of educational or job-related learning experiences, professional responsibilities and job titles that interconnect. People can select jobs or experiences with passions in various areas such as design, mathematics, technology, education, medicine and much more. Ideally, your career path should lead you toward your larger professional goals.

    For example, a person might have a long-term goal of being a published author. In this case, their career path might start with a bachelor's degree in journalism, English composition or a related subject. Their journey might also include smaller publications, a professional writing job and creative writing courses.
